# Hello 🔥

This is the front-end for my very first REST API built in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).

If you are here from my [back-end code](https://github.com/voidermalie/Piiquante) and want to run the project locally, proceed as follows:

## 🌶️ Run the project locally

#### 1. Clone this repo
#### 2. Run ```npm start``` in a terminal.
(You might need to install npm first with ```npm install```.)
#### 3. Open the page at localhost:4200
(Make sure you also launch the [back-end](https://github.com/voidermalie/Piiquante) in a separate terminal with ```node server```)

## 🌶️ Contact

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me by [mail](fannylestar@icloud.com) or message me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/fannilestar). Thanks for stopping by! 🔥
